## About the Project

Current Climate is a niche application designed for users who are passionate about climate change and are subscribed to the New York Times. The target audience of this application is people who ask for the "sports section" or the "funnies", and are easily distracted by all the other news going on in the world. Current Climate sources important climate articles from the New York Times Developer Network [(view documentation)](https://developer.nytimes.com/) in a straightforward way, and eliminates other distracting news by just focusing on climate change articles. Users are able to browse and search all climate change articles, click on a specific article to learn more, and can be redirected to that article on the New York Times website. Furthermore, users are able to favorite/unfavorite an article, and their favorites section will persist on page load. The project specs and rubic are from the Turing School of Software and Design and can be seen [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/niche-audience.html).

#### Accessibility 

Accessibility was a priority in building this application. Current Climate recieved a 100% acecessibility audit from Chrome's Lighthouse tool. Also using the Wave extension, the application has zero errors and zero contrast errors. 


## Learning Goals

- Deepen my understanding of React; class vs. function components, props, and Fetch requests
- Creating a favorites view, using `localStorage`
- Create a multi-page UX using React Router
- Testing User Stories using `Cypress`
- End to End Testing using `Cypress`

## Next Steps

- Add additional API requests to fetch other climate articles from other news sources.
- Create a login feature, so the application feels more personal.
